        > $result = Invoke-MyCommandJson -Command "GetUser"
        > Assert-AreEqual -Expected 'myHandle' -Presented $result.login
        > Assert-AreEqual -Expected 6666666 -Presented $result.id
    ```

    ```powershell
        > Get-InvokeCommandAliasList                                           

        Name                           Value

        GetUser                        gh api user
